# GSC-AMRV

A Repository where all the scripts and libraries I develop for gsc are stored so everyone can use them as they need. Keep in mind these projects are the result a lot of my free time searching for ideas, programming, polishing and publishing and I don't have that much free time.

Feel free to use any scripts you want for your games and make constructive criticism of the different projects on the repository.

The projects developed in this repository use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to form the version naming and any further change will be formed as [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) recommends.

Pleasle report any bugs or implementations you wish so I can add it and we all get a benefict from it!
